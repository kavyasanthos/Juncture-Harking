## Problem Statement
In our busy world, missing emergency messages can lead to critical situations. Juncture Harking aims to solve this by providing an automated audio alert for exigency messages sent to your mobile phone, ensuring you stay attentive to important communications.

## Solution / Idea
The project converts text or audio messages sent by the sender into automated audio responses on the receiverâ€™s device. This unique functionality eliminates the need for the receiver to manually check their phone for messages. The key features include:

Sending messages to multiple recipients simultaneously.
Automated audio repetition until acknowledgment (OK click) from the receiver.
FIFO ordered message system for multiple emergency messages.
Usage of 'Junc Hark' for quick attention during crises.

## Techniques Used
Juncture Harking leverages the following technologies:

TTS Technology: For converting text to speech.
NLP System: For automatic translation of text to break down language barriers.
Programming Languages:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end: Python
Coding
The project's code is divided into front-end and back-end components. The front-end involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end is developed using Python.

## Working Model
An example scenario:

A sender texts "All team leaders assemble in the conference hall immediately" and adds all team leaders as recipients.
The message is conveyed as an audio alert to all recipients' mobile phones, prompting them to click OK for acknowledgment.
The project ensures everyone pays attention to critical messages via automated audio.

## Uniqueness of Our Project
Juncture Harking stands out due to several unique features:

Messages are redirected to the nearest person if the recipient's phone is switched off.
Messages can be sent to other electronic devices like laptops, computers, and smart TVs.
The application serves both emergency and routine communication needs.
Special ringtones accompany messages to draw attention, similar to a fire alarm during an emergency.
